## App Review Notes (for Apple reviewers)

"Peptide OS is a personal tracking app for managing supplement protocols. It is NOT a medical app and does not provide medical advice. The app is similar to a medication reminder or supplement tracker.

The AI chat feature uses OpenAI's API to answer questions about supplements. It explicitly does not provide medical advice and always recommends consulting healthcare providers.

Demo account: No account needed - the app auto-creates a profile on first launch.

To test the main features:
1. Add a protocol from the Protocols tab
2. View Today to see the dose checklist
3. Try the Chat feature to ask about peptides
4. View Inventory to see vial tracking
5. Check the Calculator for reconstitution math"
