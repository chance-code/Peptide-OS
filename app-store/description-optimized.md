## Description (Optimized for Conversions)

**Stop guessing. Start optimizing.**

You're investing in peptides to upgrade your health—but are you getting the most out of them? Missed doses, expired vials, and scattered notes are silently sabotaging your results.

**Peptide OS is your unfair advantage.**

Finally, a tracking app built specifically for the peptide community. No more spreadsheets. No more sticky notes. No more "wait, did I already dose today?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**⚡ NEVER MISS A DOSE**

Your daily checklist shows exactly what's scheduled. One tap to log. Done.

Running multiple protocols? We handle the complexity so you don't have to. BPC-157 in the morning, Ipamorelin at night, Tirzepatide twice a week—it's all there, organized and impossible to miss.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**🧊 INVENTORY THAT WATCHES YOUR BACK**

That vial in your fridge? We'll tell you exactly when it expires—and warn you 7 days before it does.

Track reconstitution dates, concentrations, and remaining amounts. Never inject from an expired vial again. Never run out unexpectedly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**🧮 RECONSTITUTION MATH, SOLVED**

"If I add 2ml of BAC water to a 10mg vial, how many units do I draw for 250mcg?"

Stop doing peptide math in your head. Our calculator handles the conversions instantly. Plus, save your personal cheat sheet for quick reference.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT THAT KNOWS YOUR STACK**

Ask anything. Get answers that actually consider what you're already taking.

"What should I add for recovery?"
"Is it okay to take these together?"
"What's the best timing for my current stack?"

Our AI knows your active protocols and gives personalized suggestions—not generic copy-paste answers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**📊 SEE YOUR COMMITMENT**

Calendar view shows your complete history at a glance. Track adherence. Spot patterns. Stay accountable to yourself.

Green dots for completed doses. The streak builds. The results follow.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY**

• Clean, fast, no bloat
• Multiple profiles (track for yourself and others)
• Works offline
• Privacy-first (your data stays yours)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Your peptides aren't cheap. Your tracking shouldn't be an afterthought.**
